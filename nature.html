            Why is it so easy for them? Are they better parents? Do they just
            not worry about every little detail? I've never known a gorilla to
            read and study carefully seventeen books on bringing up baby
            gorillas. And they seem to know just what to do. They never worry
            about spoiling their little gorilla babies. They never worry about
            not having enough time with them. Now, don't get me wrong, I'd
            rather be human than a gorilla any day. Just imagine having to sit
            in a zoo. (Did you figure out yet that while gorillas were on my
            mind, I could only find a picture of an elephant?)

            It's hard to tell what goes through a baby elephant's mind when its
            mom is trying to put it to sleep. Do you think baby elephants wake
            up in the middle of the night and cry? Do their moms and dads take
            turns getting up with them to rock them back to sleep? How do you
            rock an elephant, anyway? And what about gorillas?
          </td>

            Today in the paper there's a story about a new gorilla that was just
            born in Franklin Park. Its mom is holding on to it just like any
            proud human mom. And I have to wonder if they go through as much
            trauma as that human mom when it comes to sleep, and food, and
            diapers, and running into the street.
