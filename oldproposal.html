      <br />
      My Website is a portfolio of my photography or other forms of artwork.

    <p id="background" class="center">
      <span class="emphasize">What Is The Main Objective of my Website?</span>
      <br />
      The Objective of my website is to show more of my creative side and
      passion for the arts. Especially since I spend a lot of time focusing on
      school and business side of things, I forget to share this part of my
      identity with the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p id="background" class="center">
      <span class="emphasize">Who Is My Target Audience?</span>
      <br />
      My target audience is anyone who wants to get to know a little bit more
      about my life and experiences! While similar styled to how one would make
      their portfolio when applying to art schools or creative positions, it is
      a fun way for me to document important moments in my life and also share
      with others.

      >
      <br />
      I am still debating on whether or not I want to include multiple types of
      media on my website or just stick with photography. If I include different
      forms of work I would have pages such as: photography, watercolor
      paintings, digital art, acrylic paintings, pen art, sketches, ect... each
      page would include photos and descriptions of my thought process behind
      the piece. If I decide to only add photography content I would have pages
      such as: portraits, nature, lifestyle/travel, product shots, furry
      friends, ect... each page would include photos relating to the category
      and maybe more of a blog styled description of where and when the photo
      took place. What do you think?
