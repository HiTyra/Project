              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my favorite activities that I
              did was the "Bali Swing." There are a few different locations
              around the island but I LOVED the one I went to. There were
              various different swing heights that have an amazing view of the
              surrounding nature as well as other photo opportunity spots. It's
              exhilarating, yet completely safe and controlled. There are many
              staff members who are super friendly that manage everything and
              even offer to take your pictures and tell you how to pose. You can
              even rent a flowy dress or skirt to make your instagram photos
              even more dynamic.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there are a lot of different
              swings available, you want to get there early in the morning or
              towards sunset to avoid long lines.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another great activities I did in
            Bali was white water rafting! Not only do you raft through Bali's
            beautiful scenery, it is fun and competitive! You get to compete
            against the other teams to get to the finish!

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A must do activity is finding all the
            secret waterfalls around the island! Some require more intense hikes
            while others have easier trails.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The waterfall is pretty cold, so
            don't expect to be able and go swimming. The tides are pretty strong
            as well.
